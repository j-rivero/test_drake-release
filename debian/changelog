    New ROS drake package based on just calling ament_vendor
    to download, build and install the version 1.24 of Drake.
    In this initial phase the GUROBI, MOSEK and SNOPT
    components are disabled in the build using the CMake
    parameters.
    The ament_vendor uses a couple of patches to deal with
    issues related to clang version and to disable the
    assumption of platform having a libjchart2d-java package.
    Patches uses the Debian DEP-3 format to include metadata
    on the same file.
    Dependencies are based on the official documentation and
    comments are in package.xml.
  * Add files via upload
  * Initial commit
